# FCH Wordpress theme

The wordpress theme for the Feminist Culture House website.

## Development

Install docker, and from the root of the project run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start wordpress and mysql in docker containers.

Go to `localhost:8000` to start.

This theme will already be installed, however you will need to setup wordpress and select the theme manually.

## Acknowledgements

This theme was originally adapted by Leah Beeferman from the Wordpress Twenty Fifteen theme. 

FCH acknowledges artist Leah Beefermanâ€™s thoughtful web design, and wishes to thank her for helping to shape 
their online presence, and collectively learn about accessible websites.
